# Entity Id Tile

The Entity Id Tile is a Tile that uses Entity Ids to reference managed objects. It has the same properties as a Tile and caches the Entity Ids of these properties on the "OnEnable" call. By not referencing managed objects and using simple blittable data types, the Tilemap is able to utilize Unity Jobs and Burst to calculate and retrieve data from the Entity Id Tile, improving performance when you set these Tiles onto the Tilemap.

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Grid**                             | The Collider shape is based on a cell of the **Tilemap**. The shape of a cell depends on the [Cell Layout](../grid-reference) of the Tilemap.                                                           |
